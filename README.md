## Gravity is Not a Fundamental Force



## üìñ Introduction

**Summary of Six Papers on Emergent Gravity**

Based on the six provided documents, this collective work presents a comprehensive theoretical framework arguing that gravity is not a fundamental force but an emergent thermodynamic and statistical phenomenon originating from the microscopic quantum structure of spacetime.

The core thesis, developed across multiple papers, posits that gravity arises from entropy gradients and quantum information dynamics (e.g., entanglement entropy, quantum mutual information, computational complexity) governed by the holographic principle. This framework reinterprets spacetime geometry through concepts of entropic force, suggesting the Einstein field equations can be derived from thermodynamic laws and information theory rather than traditional quantum field theory. Consequently, the extreme weakness of gravity compared to other forces is explained not by a small coupling constant, but statistically through the holographic scaling of degrees of freedom, where information is encoded on boundaries rather than volumes.

The research offers falsifiable predictions, including corrections to gravitational wave signals from black hole mergers, specific non-Gaussianities in the Cosmic Microwave Background, and laboratory-based quantum simulation protocols for testing entropic force effects. By challenging the need for quantizing gravity and proposing that gravitons may be emergent quasi-particles, this work provides a paradigm shift towards understanding gravity through thermodynamics, quantum information, and emergence, potentially resolving long-standing issues like the hierarchy problem and non-renormalizability.
